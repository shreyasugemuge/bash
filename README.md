# My bash rc
   
## Introduction
This is a bashrc file that I personally use to make life easier and also to make terminal look better. Several commands depend on my local scripts, files etc. This is because currently this is the raw version (0.3 as of 4/14/17). This file **Only works on my computer**. Maybe it can be used as an example i try to comment things I do, this document also entails most of the features. I tried to make the code readable too.

## Getting this file on your computer
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shreyasugemuge/bash
```
## Opening the bashrc
You dont have to use emacs, but Its really nice.
```bash
$ emacs PATH_TO_FOLDER/bash/.bashrc
```
